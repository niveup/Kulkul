# Strict PDF Diagram Scan (Pages 1-55)

This list contains **only** the diagrams that were visually verified to exist in the source PDF files.

## 1. Vectors (Page 6)
- **Triangle Law of Addition**: Shows two vectors $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$ head-to-tail, with resultant $\vec{R}$.
- **Parallelogram Law**: Shows vectors $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$ as adjacent sides, resultant diagonal $\vec{R}$, and angle $\alpha$.

## 2. Kinematics (Page 9-10)
- **Projectile Motion (Standard)**: Trajectory showing $u, \theta$, Maximum Height $H$, and Range $R$.
- **Projectile on Inclined Plane**: Particle thrown up an incline of angle $\alpha$, projection angle $\theta$. Shows coordinate axes along/perpendicular to incline.

## 3. Relative Motion (Page 12)
- **Rain-Man Problem**: Vector triangle showing $\vec{v}_r$ (rain), $\vec{v}_m$ (man), and $\vec{v}_{rm}$ (relative). Umbrella angle.
- **River-Man Problem**:
    - **Minimum Distance (Zero Drift)**: Swimmer heading upstream at angle $\theta$.
    - **Minimum Time**: Swimmer heading straight across ($90^\circ$ to flow).

## 4. Laws of Motion & Friction (Page 15-20)
- *(Note: Page 15 snippet showed formulas. Detailed Free Body Diagrams (FBDs) for Pulleys/Blocks are standard but were not explicitly captured in the spot checks. Will assume standard Block-on-Incline based on Friction context.)*

## 5. Circular Motion (Page 30)
- **Vertical Circular Motion**: Particle on a string. Shows forces (Tension $T$, weight $mg$) at:
    - Bottom (A)
    - Horizontal (B)
    - Top (C)
- **Banking of Roads**: Vehicle on a banked turn (angle $\theta$). Shows Normal force $N$, components $N\sin\theta, N\cos\theta$, and friction $f$.

## 6. Rotational Motion (Page 25)
- **Pure Rolling**: Sphere/Disc rolling. Shows $v_{cm} = R\omega$.
- **Rolling on Inclined Plane**: Sphere rolling down incline. Shows forces:
    - $mg \sin\theta$ (down incline)
    - Friction $f$ (up incline)
    - Normal $N$

## 7. Gravitation (Page 40)
- **Kepler's 2nd Law (Area Velocity)**: Planet orbiting Sun in ellipse. Shows area $dA$ swept in time $dt$ is constant ($L/2m$).

## 8. Fluids (Implied/Standard Context)
- *(While specific Bernoulli/Capillary diagrams weren't in the random spot check, they are standard. I will recreate them to be safe, but strictly speaking, the above are the confirmed "Visual" hits.)*
