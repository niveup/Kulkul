# Diagram Audit: Missing Crucial Diagrams

Based on your feedback and a review of the formulas, here is a list of missing diagrams that are crucial for understanding. I propose to generate SVGs for these.

## 1. Units & Dimensions
- [ ] **Vernier Caliper**: Reading diagram (Main Scale + Vernier Scale).
- [ ] **Screw Gauge**: Reading diagram (Linear Scale + Circular Scale).

## 2. Vectors
- [ ] **Triangle Law**: Tip-to-tail addition.
- [ ] **Polygon Law**: Multiple vectors addition.
- [ ] **Resolution of Vectors**: Rectangular components (Ax, Ay).
- [ ] **Direction Cosines**: Vector in 3D space ($\alpha, \beta, \gamma$).

## 3. Kinematics (1D & 2D)
- [ ] **Position-Time Graph**: Slope = Velocity.
- [ ] **Velocity-Time Graph**: Slope = Acc, Area = Displacement.
- [ ] **Acceleration-Time Graph**: Area = Change in Velocity.
- [ ] **Rain-Man Problem**: Vector diagram of relative velocity.
- [ ] **Projectile on Incline**: Range and Time of flight on an inclined plane.

## 4. Laws of Motion
- [ ] **FBD - Block on Horizontal Surface**: Normal, mg, friction, applied force.
- [ ] **FBD - Connected Motion**: Blocks connected by string (Tension).
- [ ] **Pulley System (Atwood Machine)**: Standard single pulley with masses m1, m2.
- [ ] **Pseudo Force**: Car accelerating, pendulum inside.

## 5. Work, Energy & Power
- [ ] **Work by Variable Force**: Graph of Force vs Displacement (Area under curve).
- [ ] **Spring-Block System**: Natural length, extension x, forces.
- [ ] **Collision (1D/2D)**: Before and After impact diagrams.

## 6. Rotational Motion
- [ ] **Moment of Inertia Visuals**: Rod, Ring, Disc, Sphere (showing axes).
- [ ] **Parallel Axes Theorem**: Axis through COM and parallel axis.
- [ ] **Perpendicular Axes Theorem**: planar body with Ix, Iy, Iz.
- [ ] **Torque (r x F)**: Vector diagram showing r, F, and theta.

## 7. Gravitation
- [ ] **Kepler's Law (Areas)**: Elliptical orbit sweeping equal areas.
- [ ] **Variation of g**: Graph of g vs r (Inside and Outside Earth).

## 8. Solids & Fluids
- [ ] **Stress-Strain Curve**: Elastic limit, yield point, fracture point.
- [ ] **Hydraulic Lift**: Pascal's Law application.
- [ ] **Terminal Velocity**: Sphere dropping in viscous fluid (Forces: mg, Buoyancy, Viscous drag).
- [ ] **Equation of Continuity**: Pipe with varying area ($A_1v_1 = A_2v_2$).

## 9. Thermal Properties
- [ ] **Thermal Expansion**: Linear ($L_0$ to $L_t$), Areal, Volume.
- [ ] **Calorimetry Graph**: Temperature vs Heat (Phase change plateaus).
