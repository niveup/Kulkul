PN junction: Forward(low R), Reverse(high R), Barrier Si=0.7V, Ge=0.3V. 3. Rectifier: Half V_dc=V_m/π, Full V_dc=2V_m/π. Ripple: Half=f, Full=2f. 4. Zener: Reverse breakdown, voltage regulator. 5. Transistor: I_E=I_B+I_C, β=I_C/I_B (20-500), α=I_C/I_E (<1). CE: Phase inversion, high gain. 6. Logic: NAND/NOR=Universal. De Morgan: Break bar, change sign. 7. LED: Forward bias emitter. Photodiode: Reverse bias detector."
